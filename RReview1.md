# Venue Provisioning Automation

## Project Description

This project automates the entire setup process for a new venue. The core idea is to create a single, streamlined workflow that, from one initial action, triggers all the necessary setups for a new location. This process, often called "provisioning" or "onboarding automation," is designed to save a massive amount of time, prevent manual errors, and ensure consistency across all new venues.

The system will work by connecting several independent systems. When a new venue is added to our central database, it will automatically kick off a series of actions, such as creating user accounts for new staff, configuring the venue's access to business applications (like CRMs or POS systems), and setting up necessary file structures.

## Current Progress

We have successfully moved from the initial concept to a defined technical architecture. Here is a summary of our progress:

* **System Architecture Defined**: We have a clear plan for how the backend, frontend, and automation logic will connect and function together.
* **Technology Stack Selected**: The core tools for the database, security, automation, and user interface have been chosen.
* **Workflow Mapped**: The end-to-end process is clearly outlined:
    1.  A user logs into a private web page.
    2.  They submit a form with the new venue's details.
    3.  The data is securely saved to the Firestore database.
    4.  This new entry automatically triggers the cloud-based automation script to begin the main provisioning tasks.

## Project Goal

The ultimate goal is to create a professional, secure, and scalable "one-click" solution for onboarding new venues. This will transform a complex, multi-step manual process into a single, automated workflow. By centralizing the process, we aim to eliminate repetitive tasks and ensure that new venues and their staff are ready for operation with minimal delay.

## Tools & Technologies Needed ðŸ§°

### **Code Repository (The Vault)**
* **Tool**: A private **GitHub** repository.
* **Purpose**: Securely store all project code.

### **The Backend (Database, Security & Logic)**
* **Tool**: **Firebase**.
* **Components**:
    * **Firestore**: To store all venue information.
    * **Firebase Authentication**: To provide a secure login page for the interface.
    * **Cloud Functions for Firebase**: To house the automation logic that runs in the background.

### **The Interface (The Front Door)**
* **Tools**: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
* **Purpose**: To build the simple, secure web page where a user will log in and fill out the form to add a new venue. This will be hosted using **Firebase Hosting**.
